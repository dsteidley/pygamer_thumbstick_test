# pygamer_thumbstick_test
Testing out the thumbstick on the pygamer.  Apparently, I do not have the firmware that corrects for the swapped X and Y axis.

Also, the results are a bit rough, but was able to scale down the values to the point where it worked fairly well.

Lastly, I am new to creating repositories in GitHub.  So, I figured this would be a pretty simple project beyond the "Hello GitHub!" tutorial.
